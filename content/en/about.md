## 🖖 Hey Friends

I'm Koh. Wild programming enthusiast, graduated from KIT with a master’s degree in mechanical engineering. Currently working in an automotive company as an embedded software engineer.

In my spare time I like to investigate strategies and challenge new things. I am building my digital garden, in which knowledge and ideas can grow and evolve over time. At the same time, I am trying to keep thinking and explore the underlying logic underneath everyday’s life, refuse to cheat and live in the moment with clarity.

Outside of studying, I like the outdoors and photography, and buying stocks sometimes.

## 💻 What I'm Working On

- ISP, CMake/Conan, Buildsystem
- Moving to a new place


## 🏕️ About Kohsruhe
Kohsruhe is my first site. I mainly write about my daily life, studies and thoughts here. 

Picking a right and good site name is not always easy. The word "Kohsruhe" is a combination of two words: Koh and Ruhe. Koh is my nickname while Ruhe is a German word, which means silence and peace. I hope this site would be a place to find my inner peace. Besides, Kohsruhe is very similar to Karlsruhe, a city I lived in when I studied for my master degree in abroad.
