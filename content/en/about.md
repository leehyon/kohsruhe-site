## 🖖 Hi, I'm Koh

Wild programming enthusiast, graduated from KIT with a master’s degree in mechanical engineering. Currently working in an American company as an automotive embedded software engineer, but still at the rookie level. I would like to use this site to keep documented and growing.

In my spare time I like to investigate methodologies and explore new things, and I am committed to building my digital garden, in which knowledge and ideas can grow and evolve over time. At the same time, I am trying to keep thinking and explore the underlying logic underneath everyday's life, refuse to cheat and be able to live in the present moment with clarity.

Outside of my studies, I like the outdoors and photography, and buying stocks sometimes.

## 🥷🏼 What I'm Working On

I switched my job recently and got a lot of things to struggle with.

I'm thinking about moving to another apartment.
